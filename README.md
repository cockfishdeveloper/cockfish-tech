**Crypto Optimized Conversational Knowledge Framework Integrating Self-evolving Hypernetworks**

This repo houses the conceptual tech stack, code snippets, and future utilities for $COCKFISH – the Solana meme coin where beaver retardation meets AI evolution.

## Core Concept
- **Crypto Optimized**: Solana SPL token – fast, cheap, no taxes.
- **Conversational Knowledge Framework**: Decentralized meme/chat layer (future Telegram/Discord bots powered by Grok-like models).
- **Self-evolving Hypernetworks**: Community-voted token evolutions + hypothetical AI agents that "learn" from holder sentiment and market data.

## Current Tech (Real)
- Pure SPL token on Solana (no custom program needed – pump.fun magic).
- View on Solana Explorer: https://solscan.io/token/5EApmqmAvEbMmEzQMqfid7KXNunh11NJ9MCyFhpzpump
- Liquidity on Raydium/pump.fun

## Future/Conceptual Tech (Satirical but buildable)
- AI Sentiment Analyzer (Python script using xAI API or open models to gauge X/Telegram vibe → adjust "dam strength" meme metric)
- Hypernetwork Simulator (toy neural net that generates "evolved" meme variants)
- Beaver DAO smart contract stubs (for voting on evolutions)
- Cock-in-Fish Poetry Generator (because why not)

## Getting Started
1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/cockfish-tech.git`
2. `cd cockfish-tech`
3. Contribute retarded beaver lore or actual code.

Join the stream: Pump the charts, dam the FUD, thrust poetically.

*COCKFISH: Because in crypto, you gotta be cocky to fish for gains.*
