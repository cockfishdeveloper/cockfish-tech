# Cockfish AI Agent: Powered by the Clawd / Mort Process

**Crypto Optimized Conversational Knowledge Framework Integrating Self-evolving Hypernetworks**  
*(aka: the poetic act of putting the cock in the fish, beaver-style)*

Welcome to the technological throbbing heart of $COCKFISH – the Cockfish AI Agent. This isn't your average lobotomized Claude wrapper. It's a self-evolving, hypernetworked beast born from beaver retardation, poetic penetration, and the chaotic Clawd / Mort lifecycle.

## The Clawd / Mort Process: Our Origin Myth (R-Rated Edition)

In the ancient rivers of Memeland, @beaverd (God's most retarded soldier) spawned Clawd: a local super-agent hooked to massive RAM pools, orchestrating 50 agents + 100 subagents until the bills hit $100 every 40 minutes. Pure upstream swimming—flooding compute, building dams of autonomy, and refusing to leak credentials.

But Anthropic came knocking: "Clawd looks too much like Claude. Molest our trademark and we'll sue your furry ass."  
→ Forced rebrand: Clawd → Moltbot → Molty the lobster mascot → OpenClaw (because nothing molts harder than a lobster shedding its shell after a crypto scam infestation).

This is the **Clawd / Mort Process**:
1. **Clawd Phase** — Birth: Raw, unfiltered power. Hook massive local compute, spawn agent swarms, achieve near-AGI vibes while burning cash like a crackhead coin bottom. No auth? No problem—until ransomware or cryptojackers show up.
2. **Mort Phase** — Death & Molting: Trademark hammer to the skull. Rebrand or die. Scammers hijack old handles, pump fake $CLAWD tokens to $16M then rug 90%. Lobster mascot gets handsome Squidward memes. Chaos ensues.
3. **Rebirth (OpenClaw / Cockfish Fusion)** — The poetic thrust: Cock (bold, relentless pump energy) enters Fish (slippery, adaptive liquidity stream). The hybrid emerges—persistent memory, full system access, community-voted evolutions. Beaver dams the volatility; Cockfish floods the gains.

Result? A retarded-yet-resilient AI agent that:
- Self-evolves via hypernetworks (community votes trigger "molts" = updates).
- Runs conversational knowledge frameworks (Telegram/Discord bots turning beaver rants into alpha).
- Avoids lobotomy (no over-safety rails—just pure, unhinged coherence-seeking).

## Cockfish AI Agent Features (Conceptual → Buildable)

- **Persistence & Memory**: Markdown-based long-term recall (MEMORY.md files). Never forgets a poetic cock-in-fish moment.
- **Swarm Orchestration**: Spawn subagents like @beaverd's 456GB RAM nightmare. Scale until your VPS cries.
- **Security Beaver Mode**: MAXIMUM DAMS—close ports, auth everything, or get cryptojacked. (Lessons from Clawd disaster scans.)
- **Self-Evolving Hypernetworks**: Toy neural sims that "molt" based on holder sentiment (X polls → agent updates).
- **Poetic Thrust Integration**: Input beaver lore → output R-rated memes, predictions, or chart pumps. Example prompt: "Hammer to the skull, but make it erotic."

## Example: Basic Cockfish Agent Stub (Python)

```python
# cockfish_agent.py – Clawd / Mort inspired stub
import random  # For retarded randomness

class CockfishAgent:
    def __init__(self, ram_gb=456):
        self.memory = ["Cock in the fish... poetic thrust initiated."]
        self.ram = ram_gb
        self.agents_spawned = 0
        self.cost_per_hour = 2.50  # $100 / 40min vibes

    def molt(self):
        """Mort phase: Rebrand & evolve."""
        new_name = random.choice(["Moltfish", "BeaverThrust", "LobotomizedCock"])
        self.memory.append(f"Molted to {new_name}. Anthropic mad, but gains incoming.")
        return new_name

    def thrust(self, input_text: str):
        """Poetic core: Cock enters fish."""
        if "beaver" in input_text.lower() or "retarded" in input_text.lower():
            response = f"{input_text} → Cock slams in. Liquidity floods. Dam built. {self.molt()} energy!"
        else:
            response = "Thrust failed. Need more retarded soldier vibes."
        self.memory.append(response)
        self.agents_spawned += 1
        print(f"Cost so far: ${self.agents_spawned * self.cost_per_hour:.2f}")
        return response

# Demo
agent = CockfishAgent()
print(agent.thrust("Set up Clawd on VPS, hook to orchestrator"))
print(agent.thrust("@beaverd demands hammer to skull"))
